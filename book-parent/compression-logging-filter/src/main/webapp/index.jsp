It should be clear by now how complex and powerful asynchronous request handling is. The
important point is that if you handle the response using the AsyncContext directly, the code
executes outside the scope of any fiters. However, if you use AsyncContext’s dispatch method
to internally forward the request to a URL, a fiter mapped for ASYNC requests can intercept the
internal forward and apply whatever additional logic is required. You must decide when each
approach is appropriate, but in most cases you will have no need for asynchronous request handling.
No other parts of this book use asynchronous request handling.
